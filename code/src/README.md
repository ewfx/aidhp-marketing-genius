## What is this section about?

Here we have created a bunch of AI Agents suing Langchain, Firebase Functions and Gemini 2.0 Flash to gather real time data and generate insights+ recommendations + ad content after every 5 hours.
In short, its 5-6 social media manager AI agents! How cool is that, right!??

# How to use these agents locally?
1) Create a python virtual environment. We prefer miniconda, but feel free to use Python venv if you're comfortable with that.
2) Then pip install requirememts.txt
3) Then cd into the NonCustomerAgents folder
4) run `python ain.py`. Viola, you have a couple of social media managers working for you now!
